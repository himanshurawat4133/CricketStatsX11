                                                          **CricketStatsX11**

Hello, All Data Enthusiast, this is a Data Analysis Project on making the best 11-player team from ICC Mens T20 Cricket World Cup, 2022 or I simply call that CricketStatsX11.

The project involves:-

•	Python Pandas – For data cleaning and conversion from JSON to CSV

•	Power Query – For data transformation

•	DAX Measures -  To calculate Cricket Statistics like – Batting Average, Strike Rate, Bowling Economy, etc.

•	 Power BI – For creating an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that will allow you to analyze different player statistics.

Ultimately, one can analyze the player’s statistics and select the best 11-player team. My team contains (2 Openers, 3 Middle Order Batsman, 1 Finisher, 2 Spin Bowling All Rounders, and 3 Fast Bowlers)

You can select your own best 11-player team by your analysis skill.

**How to Run:-**

To run the project download the (.pbix) file from folder CricketStatsX11 and run it on Power BI web or Power BI Desktop.

If needed, you can also download the (.csv) file from t20_csv_files folder.

There is a pdf file also that contains the screenshots of the dashboard.
